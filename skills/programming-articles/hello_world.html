<h1>HTML Hello World</h1>

<pre>
    How are webpages such as the one you are reading right now made?
    The answer is simple:
        They are written using a special language the computer can understand called HTML.
    HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.

    Everything in HTML is made out of tags.
    Tags are used to make things on the page.
    Some tags show text, while some show big headings.
    Some tags show images, while some show videos.

    All tags look like this:
    A &lt;, then the name of the tag, then a &gt;, then the content, then a &lt;, a /, the name of the tag, and &gt;.

    For example, the <b>p</b> tag, used for paragraphs, looks like this:
</pre>
<pre class="code">
    &lt;p&gt;
        This is a paragraph.
    &lt;/p&gt;
